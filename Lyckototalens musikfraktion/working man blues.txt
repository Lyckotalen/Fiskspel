[Intro]

[Verse 1]

A

It's a big job gettin' by with 9 kids and a wife

Yeah but I been a workin' man dang near all my life

     D7

I'll keep on workin’

A

Long as my two hands are fit to use

  E7

I drink my beer at a tavern

    D7     A

And sing a little bit of these workin’ man blues

A

Well I keep my nose on the grindstone, work hard every day

Gettin’ tired on the weekend, after I draw my pay

      D7

But I go back workin’,

    A

Come Monday mornin’ I'm right back with the crew

  E7

I drink a little beer that evenin’,

D7     A

[Verse 2]

A

Sometimes I think about leavin’, do a little bummin’ around

 

Throw my bills out the window catch me a train to another town

      D7

But I go back workin’

 A

I got to buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes

  E7

I drink my beer at a tavern

    D7    A

And cry a little bit of these workin’ man blues

 

(Instrumental solo for one verse)

A

Well hey hey, the workin’ man, the workin’ man like me

Never been on welfare, and that's one place he would not be

D7

He’d be workin’

 A

Just as long as his two hands are fit to use

      E7

Might drink a little beer at a tavern

D7    A

Sing a little bit of them workin’ man blues
