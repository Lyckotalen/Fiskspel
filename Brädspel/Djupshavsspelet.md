Euro-Style Games:

Euro-style games are often about gaining victory points, an arbitrary resource that allows you to win. They usually last a certain number of turns, or continue until one player has a certain number of victory points. These games have strong themes which inform much of the design. There is also usually a system of resource management, and some kind of "political" play between the players as they negotiate the sale and trade of resources. Finally, these games have fewer elements of luck or chance, and most issues the player experiences because of "bad luck" can be mitigated with strong strategic play.

Examples: Settlers of Catan, Power Grid, Carcassone, and Lancaster


Strategy Games:

Strategy games are much grander Euro-style games. These games usually have a very important board and a narrative which drives the game's progress. These games often involve a heavy amount of co-op and competitive play, forcing players to make and break alliances over the course of the game.

Players are usually participating as much in the game itself as they are in higher-level mind-games with each other: trying to get ahead, form alliances, and discern their opponent's motives. These games are generally marked by very long game sessions (six hours or more, for some), and are sometimes affectionately referred to as "friendship-ending games", because of how passionate players become. Risk is perhaps the most well-known game in this genre.

Examples: Risk, Twilight Imperium, Arkham Horror, and Battlestar Galactica

Ask yourself questions like:

    How many players will there be?
    How long should the game be?
    What choices will the player make, and when will they make them?
    How will the player make these choices?
    How will one player's choice impact the other players?
    How will the players interact with each other?
    Are there any choices that can be made by one player, but not by the others?
    How does the game progress? Is it strictly turn-based, or is it in rounds with phases?
    What actions will the player be able to take?
    How will the outcome of an action be determined?
    What is the player's goal?
    How can the player win?
